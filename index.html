    <h1>I'm bored, let's play some manacala!</h1>
    <ul>
        <h3>Rules:</h3>
        <li><h3>Each player has 6 pockets and 1 store, get the most stones in your store (the oval shaped section to your right) by the end of the game to win!</h3></li>
        <li><h3>You being the game by picking up all the marbles in one of your pockets and moving counter-clockwise, deposit one of the stones in each pocket until the stones run out</h3></li>
        <li><h3>You can place a marble into your own stores on the way, but skip your opponents</h3></li>
        <li><h3>If the last piece you drop is in your own store, take another turn</h3></li>
        <li><h3>If the last piece you drop is in an empty pocket on your side, capture that piece and any pieces in pockets opposite of yours</h3></li>
        <li><h3>the game ends when all six pockets one on side of the board are empty</h3></li>
        <li><h3>the player who still has pieces on his side of the board when the game ends captures all those pieces</h3></li>
    </ul>
